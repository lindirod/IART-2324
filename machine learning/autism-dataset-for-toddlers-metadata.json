condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.  The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of toddlers that contained influential features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features plus other individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science. \n\nA1-A10: Items within Q-Chat-10  in which questions possible answers : \u201CAlways, Usually, Sometimes, Rarly \u0026 Never\u201D items\u2019 values are mapped to \u201C1\u201D or \u201C0\u201D in the dataset. For questions 1-9 (A1-A9) in Q-chat-10,  if the respose was  Sometimes / Rarly / Never \u201C1\u201D is assigned to the question (A1-A9). However, for question 10 (A10), if the respose was Always / Usually / Sometimes then \u201C1\u201D is assigned to that question. If the user obtained More than 3 Add points together for all ten questions. If your child scores more than 3 (Q-chat-10- score) then there is a potential ASD traits otherwise no ASD traits are observed. The other details are collected through an application.\n\nA1 -  Does your child look at you when you call his/her name?\nA2 - How easy is it for you to get eye contact with your child? \nA3 - Does your child point to indicate that s/he wants something? (e.g. a toy that is \nout of reach) \nA4 - Does your child point to share interest with you? (e.g. pointing at an \ninteresting sight) \nA5 - Does your child pretend? (e.g. care for dolls, talk on a toy phone) \nA6 - Does your child follow where you\u2019re looking? \nA7 - If you or someone else in the family is visibly upset, does your child show signs \nof wanting to comfort them? (e.g. stroking hair, hugging them)\nA8 - Would you describe your child\u2019s first words as unusual?\nA9 - Does your child use simple gestures? (e.g. wave goodbye) \nA10 - Does your child stare at nothing with no apparent purpose? \n"}
